Here we will try to collect different ways of solving the Boltzmann equation (BE) with a focus on dark matter production.

The idea is to have a place with helpful notes and computational techniques.


For the moment this repository is a placeholder for things to come (implementation in C++, mathematica, and code tailored to this specific problem). 
At this point,  I have written some notes and I have collected some data on the relativistic degrees of freedom.

The ultimate goal is to build the "ultimate" Boltzmann equation solver!

Let's see how it goes. 

Enjoy (in a few months).
